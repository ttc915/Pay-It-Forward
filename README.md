# Pay It Forward (PIF) üå±

**ETHCluj Hackathon 2025**  
Empowering local communities, schools, and NGOs through transparent blockchain-based fundraising.

---

## üß† Project Summary

**Pay It Forward (PIF)** is a decentralized donation platform that allows parents, communities, and donors to fund school and local initiatives using crypto-backed smart contracts. 

Donors receive PIF tokens as a reward and can always trust that funds will be used transparently, via smart contracts.

> ‚ÄúA teacher launches a project to fund 10 new desks for a rural school. Donations flow in via a RON-pegged stablecoin, and each supporter receives PIF tokens as thanks. If the goal isn‚Äôt reached in 3 months, everyone gets their money back.‚Äù

## üí° Key Features
- üèóÔ∏è **Simple Architecture**
  Focused on ease of use and initiative creation.

- ‚è≥ **Time & Amount-Limited Initiatives**
  Projects have specific deadlines (max 3 months) and target amounts.

- üí∏ **Automatic Refund Mechanism**
  If the goal isn‚Äôt met, smart contracts refund all donors without needing any manual action.

- ü™ô **Reward Token: PIF**  
  Every donor earns PIF tokens as recognition for their contribution.
  
- üîí **Transparent Smart Contract Logic**  
  All donations are locked in smart contracts until conditions are met (funded or expired).

- üåä **Ocean Protocol Integration**  
  Donation metadata is published as decentralized data assets for transparency and public access.

## üîó Architecture Overview

Each **Project** (school, NGO, etc.) can host multiple **Initiatives**.  

Each initiative includes:
- Goal amount in RON (via stable token)
- Deadline (max 3 months)
- Real-world purpose (e.g., buying 10 school benches)

```mermaid

    A[Create Initiative]
    B[Publish Metadata on Ocean Protocol]
    C[Receive Donations]
    D[Hold Funds in Smart Contract]
    E{Deadline or Goal Reached?}
    F[Settle & Distribute Rewards]
    G[Refund Donations]
    H[Accept More Donations]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E
    E -- Goal Met --> F
    E -- Deadline Passed --> G
    E -- Ongoing --> H

```

All logic is handled on-chain through smart contracts written in Solidity using Hardhat.

> *(Planned IPFS support to attach image + description metadata to each initiative)*

## üåä Data Transparency with Ocean Protocol

To enhance trust, all initiative and donation metadata is published as **data NFTs** on Ocean Protocol.

- üßæ Each initiative‚Äôs metadata is stored immutably (goal, deadline, description)
- üåç Donors can view real-time funding data via Ocean‚Äôs decentralized marketplace
- üîê Future expansion may use **Compute-to-Data** for insights while protecting donor privacy

This creates:
- A transparent, decentralized public record
- Verifiable donation history
- Potential for third-party analysis, funding metrics, and DAO integrations

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity + Hardhat
- **Frontend**: [Coming Soon]
- **Tokens**:
  - `PIF`: ERC20 Reward Token
  - `RONToken`: Stablecoin-pegged donation token
- **Data Layer**: Ocean Protocol (data NFTs + metadata publishing)
  
---

## üîê Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ All funds are time-locked until either:
  - Target is reached ‚Üí allows payout
  - Deadline passes without funding ‚Üí enables refund

- üö´ No owner withdrawal privileges unless project conditions are fully met  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional validation to prevent early rugpulls (donation lock-in period)

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Onboarding

### Requirements

- Node.js ‚â• 18.x
- Hardhat ‚â• 2.22
- Foundry (optional)
- Git & npm

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttc915/Pay-It-Forward.git
cd Pay-It-Forward
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
RPC_URL=your_ethereum_node_url
```

#### 4. Using Remix Web IDE
You can easily interact with the smart contracts using Remix IDE:

#### 4. Using Remix Web IDE with remixd
You can connect your local project to Remix IDE using `remixd` for a seamless development experience:

1. Install `@remix-project/remixd` globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @remix-project/remixd
   ```

2. Start `remixd` in the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   remixd -s . -u https://remix.ethereum.org
   ```

3. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
4. In the File Explorer, click the "Open" button
5. Select "Connect to localhost" and ensure your local Hardhat node is running:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```
6. Or, to connect directly to the repository:
   - Click on the "Workspaces" dropdown
   - Select "Clone from GitHub"
   - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/ttc915/Pay-It-Forward`
   - Press Enter to load the project

7. Compile the contracts:
   - Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab
   - Select the appropriate compiler version (matching your `hardhat.config.js`)
   - Click "Compile"

8. Deploy and interact with contracts:
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Select "Injected Provider" (e.g., MetaMask) or "Hardhat Provider" for local testing
   - Deploy contracts and interact with them using the UI

#### 5. Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Run coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

#### 6. Local Development Network
Start a local Hardhat network:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

In a separate terminal, deploy contracts to the local network:
```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```

#### 7. Verifying Contracts
To verify contracts on Etherscan:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract_address> <constructor_arguments>
```
