# Pay It Forward (PIF) 🌱

**ETHCluj Hackathon 2025**  
Empowering local communities, schools, and NGOs through transparent blockchain-based fundraising.

## 🧠 Project Summary

**Pay It Forward (PIF)** is a decentralized donation platform that enables users—especially parents and community members—to fund grassroots initiatives (like school projects or local campaigns). Donors receive PIF tokens as rewards, and all funds are transparently managed via smart contracts.

> If the funding goal isn't met by the deadline, donations are automatically refunded.

## 🔗 Architecture Overview

Each **Project** (school, NGO, etc.) can host multiple **Initiatives**.  
Each initiative includes:

- Goal amount in RON (via stable token)
- Deadline (max 3 months)
- Real-world purpose (e.g., buying 10 school benches)

All logic is handled on-chain through smart contracts written in Solidity using Hardhat.
